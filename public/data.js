        "My journey into coding started back in 2019 when a friend introduced me to React and it's been full steam ahead since then. I taught myself the basics of JavaScript alongside an online course for web development and ended up building a few of my own full stack web applications using React, Node.js and TypeScript, breaking a lot of code along the way. Soon after, I landed my current role as a Full Stack Engineer at ListenField where I get to work on front and back end projects in React, TypeScript and Ruby.",

        "Not satisfied with just web development, I decided to embark on a computer science course in 2023 and got to grips with the fundamentals of computer science and built a couple of personal projects in Java to cement my understanding of the core concepts as well as of the language.",
